## Action Form

HTML light DOM web component to add useful functionality to forms

### TODO

- [ ] Add ARIA to error messages. Need to sort out the best way to do this.
- [ ] Get form-group working to hide/show based on other fields value
- [ ] Get form-step working to hide/show based on if prior steps are completed
- [ ] Make sure that resetting the form also hides all error messages
